            <p id="tribute-info">Was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman 
                received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 jointly with Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga. </p>
